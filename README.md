# About

The Sketches repository contains a collection of some of my sketches for the
Arduino, Teensy and ESP8266 micro controller platforms.

Each directory contains its corresponding README file which describes the
specific requirements etc.

In order not to conflict with other license models, third party libraries are not
included into these projects but links to them (for downloading) are provided.
For some third party libraries patch instructions are given, if applicable.

# Code Quality

This is experimental code.

# Sub-projects

## Libraries

A collection of my own libraries. They have to be copied/symlinked to the
Arduino libraries directory.

## Python

Here are some Python support/steering scripts for the various projects located.

## Memory/FlashReader

Arduino based device which can read EPROMs and EEPROMs in 24 .. 32 pin DIP cases
but not in 40 pin cases.

Tested (so far) with the following devices (reading):
- EPROM 2732
- EPROM 2764
- EPROM 27128
- EPROM 27256
- EPROM 27512
- Flash W29C020

and writing:
- None

## Transverter

Control software to steer two rigs, one for transmitting in the 28 MHz band
and one for receiving in the 70 MHz band. Both rigs are synchronized via the
CAT protocol.

The folder contains a separate README file.

## TreibBoje

Some experimental software running on a swimming beacon (buoy). It uses a
cheap 433 MHz transmitter and send its data via Morse signs (CW).

In an earlier implementation the rc-switch code was used and the received
packets where decoded on a Raspberry but the achieved distance for error-free
decoding was too low.
